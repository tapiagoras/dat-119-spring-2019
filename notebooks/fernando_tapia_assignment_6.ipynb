    "2. Write a random number guessing game!\n",
    "    - Your program should generate a random number in the range from 1 through 100 and ask the user to guess what the number is. If they guess too high, the program should display “Too high, try again.” If they guess too low, the program should display “Too low, try again.” If they guess the correct number, the application should congratulate them, tell them how many guesses it took, and ask if they want to play again. If they do, the program should generate a new random number and let them play again. (We did functions this week, so I'm going to expect to see you use those.)\n",
